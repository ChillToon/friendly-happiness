- How do I approach designing software?

Depending on the type of software I'm designing, I look what the software's main goal is, and implement features that help it achieve it. Afterwards, I look at the software's functional and non-functional goals. After narrowing down the goals, I plan out the project and design the software's structure (how different components will interact with each other.), as well as design the software's UI and UX. Once I complete both of these things, I begin working on the software. I believe keeping this design approach can be applied to my future work, as well.

- How do I approach developing programs?

When developing programs, similar to designing software, I look at what the program's main goal is, and develop it to achieve its goal as fast and efficiently as possible. While developing it, I make sure to think of any issues the program can run into that can hinder it and develop my code precisely so the program doesn't run into said issues.

- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science helps me hone my critical thinking skills, which is key when it comes to software developing. Additionally, computer science makes us adaptable, since learning new tools and methodologies keeps us up to date and competitive when it comes to potential job positions.  Lastly, there is versatility. Since computer science teaches us a multitude of different skills, it can prepare us for different kinds of work in various industries.
