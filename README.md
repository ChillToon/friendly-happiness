- How do I approach designing software?

Depending on the type of software I'm designing, I look what the software's main goal is, and implement features that help it achieve it. Afterwards, I look at the software's functional and non-functional goals. After narrowing down the goals, I plan out the project and design the software's structure (how different components will interact with each other.), as well as design the software's UI and UX. Once I complete both of these things, I begin working on the software. I believe keeping this design approach can be applied to my future work, as well.

- How do I approach developing programs?

When developing programs, similar to designing software, I look at what the program's main goal is, and develop it to achieve its goal as fast and efficiently as possible. While developing it, I make sure to think of any issues the program can run into that can hinder it and develop my code precisely so the program doesn't run into said issues.

- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Compuster science helps me hone my problem-solving skills when it comes to finding the best way to develop a program/software. Additionally, developing and programming can help me become more innovative, which in turn can help me find new ideas to effiecently develop programs and software.
